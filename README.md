# Decred Events

Welcome! This is a central resource to collect upcoming events the Decred community will be attending, highlighting how you can get involved. We are also building out a best practice guide for community members to brief themselves on if they are representing Decred at an event.

**You probably want to do one of the following:**

[View reports for past events](https://github.com/heyvj/decred-events/tree/master/reports)

[Submit report for past event](https://github.com/heyvj/decred-events/wiki/Submit-Event-Report)

## Objectives

### 1. Past Events

* Single destination for event write-ups and logs
* Show the community what Decred has been doing for marketing and awareness through event participation

### 2. Best Practices and How-Tos for Events

* Collate learnings from various events into a single location so Decred can boss events as our shared experience of event participation grows
* Ensure community participants are as effective as possible by using and building our collective experience
